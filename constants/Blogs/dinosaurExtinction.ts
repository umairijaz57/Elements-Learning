  "title": "The story of dinosaur extinction",
  "summary": "In 1956, Joseph Shklovsky theorized that a supernova caused the dinosaurs' extinction. In the 1970s, Walter Alvarez discovered a thin layer of clay, known as the KT boundary, which marked a mass extinction event. With help from his father Luis Alvarez and chemist Frank Asaro, they found high levels of iridium in the clay, suggesting a global impact event. Initially ridiculed, their asteroid impact theory gained credibility after Alan Hildebrand identified the Chicxulub crater in Mexico in 1990. The 1994 impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter demonstrated the potential for such catastrophic events, supporting the Alvarez hypothesis. This summary is based on information from various sources, notably Bill Bryson.",

This is a point known to geology as the KT boundary, and it marks the time, sixty-five million years ago, when the dinosaurs and roughly half the world's other species of animals abruptly vanished from the fossil record. K comes either from the Greek Kreta or the German Kreide. Both conveniently mean “chalk,” which is also what Cretaceous means. Alvarez wondered what it was about a thin lamina of clay, barely a quarter of an inch thick, that could account for such a dramatic moment in Earth's history. But the thinness of the clay layer clearly suggested that in Umbria, if nowhere else, something rather more abrupt had happened. Unfortunately, in the 1970s, no tests existed for determining how long such a deposit might have taken to accumulate.",

For most geologists, the idea of a devastating impact was, as Eugene Shoemaker noted, “against their scientific religion.” As late as 1988, more than half of all American paleontologists contacted in a survey continued to believe that the extinction of the dinosaurs was in no way related to an asteroid or cometary impact.",

The formation had been found by Pemex, the Mexican oil company, in 1952—the year, coincidentally, that Gene Shoemaker first visited Meteor Crater in Arizona—but the company's geologists had concluded that it was volcanic, in line with the thinking of the day. Hildebrand traveled to the site and decided fairly swiftly that they had their crater. By early 1991, it had been established to nearly everyone's satisfaction that Chicxulub was the impact site.",
